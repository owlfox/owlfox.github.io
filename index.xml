      <description>This is the note of js 30 days challenging, and the first days is about event handler and audio element. I am still far away from fluent to use javascript everywhere&amp;hellip; So I guess this kind of practice helps.
Below is the code I implemented:
function playSound(e) { //why use key code? I guess it&#39;s for both upper and lower case. //and cross browser support... const keyCode = event.keyCode //data- used for self-made attribute const audio = document.</description>

      <description>Airport to CBD(central business district) I took scoot airline from Taiwan to Melbourne, with a transfer in Singapore. The transporation from airport to CBD is fairly convenient. By taking skybusï¼ˆdouble decked bus) outside of the airport, with costs ~20A$, I um.. arrived safely.
Hostel I stayed in Europa Melbourne, which provides free breakfast and not so fast wifi. The location of it is actually very good(inside of CBD).
Foods I have been eating DONDON for a while and besides that, I have done gensuke hakata ramen, some chicken kebab, pork souvlaki and some eatable foods by myself lol.</description>

      <title>My first debian conf :)</title>

      <description>I was so lucky to be able to attend this summer and helping the video team to accomplish some tasks!
What is debian conf? DebConf is the Debian Project&amp;rsquo;s developer conference. Where Debian developers(DDs) came from everywhere.
I wish I could contribute more and be more involved into the debian community next year in Brazil.
What I have done? Basically I am doing some simple tasks like handing the camera(The camera operator), the guy who plays with the PA system(audio techinician), director(controlls which camera to feed into the live-stream) during the debconf.</description>
