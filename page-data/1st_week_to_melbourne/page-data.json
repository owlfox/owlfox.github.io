The transporation from airport to CBD is fairly convenient. By taking skybus（double decked bus) outside of the airport, with costs ~20A$, I um.. arrived safely.</p>\n<h2>Hostel</h2>\n<p>I stayed in Europa Melbourne, which provides free breakfast and not so fast wifi. The location of it is actually very good(inside of CBD).</p>\n<h2>Foods</h2>\n<p>I have been eating DONDON for a while and besides that, I have done gensuke hakata ramen, some chicken kebab, pork souvlaki and some eatable foods by myself lol.</p>\n<h2>Fitzory Swimming Pool</h2>\n<p>I think this is the only public swimming pool opened in winter of Melbourne. The entrance fee is 6.9 A$, and the locker fee is 3 A$. I lost my swimming goggles here Orz after the 10th time use. Any way, if want to buy swimming gears, you can buy it here. The swimming pool is outdoor and heated, quite interesting since one side is like 6m depth while the other side is 1m I guess. Sauna, steam room are included, nice! The only drawback is it's out of free tram zone...</p>\n<h2>State Library of Victoria</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Great internet speed on weekdays, although port 22 are blocked..</li>\n<li>beautiful&#x26;histroical building,table.</li>\n<li>if you are looking for books, there's plenty of it! although it's not as many as university library I guess...</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Fishing!</h2>\n<p>I went to fishing or say squiding with IT friends from Taiwan. We used northcraft(木蝦) to fish the squids(軟絲). It's quite interesting actually. One is that it's quite relaxing when you're casting fishing rod. I once felt sorry about fishing the squid, but once I eated it, my gratitude overrides the guilty to them.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"First week to Melbourne","date":"02 September, 2018","tags":["travel"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/1st_week_to_melbourne/"}}}
