      <description>I was so lucky to be able to attend this summer and helping the video team to accomplish some tasks!
What is debian conf? DebConf is the Debian Project&amp;rsquo;s developer conference. Where Debian developers(DDs) came from everywhere.
I wish I could contribute more and be more involved into the debian community next year in Brazil.
What I have done? Basically I am doing some simple tasks like handing the camera(The camera operator), the guy who plays with the PA system(audio techinician), director(controlls which camera to feed into the live-stream) during the debconf.</description>
