      <description>Airport to CBD(central business district) I took scoot airline from Taiwan to Melbourne, with a transfer in Singapore. The transporation from airport to CBD is fairly convenient. By taking skybusï¼ˆdouble decked bus) outside of the airport, with costs ~20A$, I um.. arrived safely.
Hostel I stayed in Europa Melbourne, which provides free breakfast and not so fast wifi. The location of it is actually very good(inside of CBD).
Foods I have been eating DONDON for a while and besides that, I have done gensuke hakata ramen, some chicken kebab, pork souvlaki and some eatable foods by myself lol.</description>
